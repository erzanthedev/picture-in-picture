# Picture-in-Picture Application 📺

Welcome to the Picture-in-Picture (PiP) project!
This application allows you to view your screen's content in a small, always-on-top window, perfect for multitasking.
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, combining modern web technologies to create a seamless and interactive user experience.

## How It Works ⚙️

1. **Capture Screen Content**: The application uses an asynchronous function to call the Capture API, which captures the screen contents using `getDisplayMedia()`.
2. **User Prompt**: Upon clicking the "Start" button, the user is prompted to select the screen they want to view in Picture-in-Picture mode.
3. **Display in PiP Mode**: The selected screen content is then displayed in a small, floating window that remains on top of other windows.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **HTML**: For structuring the application layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and ensuring a polished look.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and handling the screen capture process.
